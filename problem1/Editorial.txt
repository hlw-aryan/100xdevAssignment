This program handles user registration requests for a social media platform, ensuring each username is unique. Here's how it works:

1. Input Reading:
   - The program first reads the number of registration requests.
   - It then processes each request one by one.

2. Username Handling:
   - For each requested username, the program checks if it already exists in a map (a data structure that stores key-value pairs).
   - If the username does not exist, it is added to the map with a value of 0, and the program outputs "OK" to indicate successful registration.
   - If the username already exists, the program increments the count associated with that username in the map and suggests a new username by appending this count to the original username (e.g., "username1", "username2", etc.). This new username is then outputted and stored in the map.

3. Output:
   - The program prints "OK" for successful registrations or the new unique username if the original was taken.

This way, every username in the system is unique, either as initially requested or modified with a numerical suffix.

Time Complexity:

Since the loop iterates n times, the overall time complexity of the code is: O(n * log m)
Where:
    n is the number of iterations (input size)
    m is the number of elements in the Map container

Space Complexity:

Map Storage:
    The map Map stores each unique username along with its corresponding count. In the worst case, if all usernames are unique, the map will store n usernames.

In summary:

Time Complexity: O(n * log m)
Space Complexity: O(n)
